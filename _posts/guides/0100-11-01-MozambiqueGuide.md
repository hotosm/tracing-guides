<h2 class="section-heading">About Malaria Prevention</h2>

<h4> Mozambique </h4><p>Malaria prevention and control remains a major U.S. foreign assistance objective and PMI's Strategy fully aligns with the U.S. Government's vision of ending preventable child and maternal deaths and ending extreme poverty. Under the PMI Strategy for 2015-2020, the U.S. Government's goal is to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long-term goal of elimination. 


<p>Once remote mapping for these districts is complete, Peace Corps Volunteers and their Mozambican counterparts on the ground will use printed Field Papers to groundtruth and add local knowledge to the remotely traced base map. These districts will host IRS (indoor residual spraying) campaigns for malaria prevention in October 2016. The IRS campaigns are sponsored by the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and implemented by Abt Associates. Geographic data from OpenStreetMap will help the planning teams to better estimate the number of sprayable households per village or town.

<h4> Tracing Tips </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Save often when editing long linear features such as waterways or roads. These features are continuous and appear in multiple cells across the project area which can cause errors when edited by multiple users. </li>
  <li> Pay close attention to alignment of imagery and adjust when necessary. Imagery should be adjusted to match existing OSM data. </li>
 </ul>
