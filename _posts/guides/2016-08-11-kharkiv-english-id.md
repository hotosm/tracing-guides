<h2 class="section-heading">Kharkiv, Ukraine</h2>

 <p>
 Help us to map critical infrastructure in Kharkiv. Using current high-resolution imagery, we will digitize roads, buildings, and open areas within the city â€“ resulting in a free and open map data of Kharkiv. OpenStreetMap will be used as the platform to digitize, store, and share such critical data for usage by first responders, planners and geospatial enthusiasts.
