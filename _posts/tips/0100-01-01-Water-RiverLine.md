Linear feature
#### Waterway = River

Linear rivers and smaller and flow into Area rivers.  For this project, linear rivers are less than 15M wide.  Depending on the editor you are using you may not be able to measure the width.  If you do not have a measure tool, estimate the width of the river by comparing it to surrounding features.

Here's an example of a linear river flowing into an area river feature. Notice the muddy discharge from the liner river.
