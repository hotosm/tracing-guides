All roads are classified as some type of highway. Roads are primarily classified based on their function. After drawing a line using iD editor you will select the <img href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2665840/17753387/a0454342-649d-11e6-939b-f7c778cf7660.PNG"> button the you will see the different road classifications. On your right you will see the main types of roads you will typically classify:

<h3> Residential Road </h3>

Roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing.

<h3> Primary Road </h3>

A major highway linking large towns

<h3> Secondary Road </h3>

A highway which is not part of a major route, but nevertheless forming a link in the national route network.

<h3> Tertiary Road </h3>

A road connecting smalrler settlements, and within large settlements for roads connecting local centres.

<h3> Minor/Unclassified Road </h3>

A minor roadss of a lower classification than tertiary, but which serve a purpose other than access to properties. Often link villages and hamlets. (The word 'unclassified' is a historical artefact of the UK road system and does not mean that the classification is unknown)

<h3> surface = * </h3>

In addition to using the highway tag, one can indicate the physical surface of the road with the surface tag:

Generically, a hard surface (asphalt, cobblestone, concrete...) is indicated with surface=paved and a soft one (ground, sand...) with surface=unpaved.
