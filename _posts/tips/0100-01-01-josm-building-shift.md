Building polygons should be drawn to overlap the base of the building. There is a noticeable difference between the base of the building and the roof for tall buildings when imagery is taken at an oblique angle. A good strategy for drawing these buildings is to trace the top of the building first, then move the polygon towards the base of the building.
